# Wavelet Generative Adversarial Networks
This projects was based on BEGAN to solve how to make a model can learn to generate images which contain the high or low frequency part different from that of training datasets.This model's novel points: 1. Two discriminators "teach" one generator. 2. A high frequency filter and a low frequency filer are put in front of first layers of two discriminators respectively, so the discriminators' ability is limited so that they just penalize difference of  the high or low frequency part between real samples and  fake samples.
